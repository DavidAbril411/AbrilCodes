      "I'm David Abril, a professional developer with an 8.75/10 GPA in Computer Engineering. My journey began at MindFactory, where I developed core skills before venturing out to create Abril Codes, blending creativity and technology into unique digital solutions.",
      "At Abril Codes, I collaborate with a talented team: Valentina Correa (graphic designer) and Francisco Ameri (software engineer and project manager). Together, we create solutions that balance cutting-edge technology with thoughtful design. I'm particularly proud of our approach that values both technical excellence and the human element in every project we undertake.",
      "I firmly believe in the value that academic knowledge brings to software development. When building my team, I prioritize individuals with strong educational backgrounds, as university education provides a solid foundation of theoretical principles and problem-solving methodologies that are essential for creating sophisticated, well-documented solutions that stand the test of time."

    "aiTitle": "My AI Philosophy",
    "aiBody": "My approach to AI in development is pragmatic: it should enhance human creativity, not replace it. While AI can handle syntax and implementation details, developers must retain deep understanding of fundamentals. I don't believe in memorizing what AI can generate with a simple prompt—instead, I invest my energy in mastering core concepts and problem-solving skills that allow me to effectively direct AI tools while maintaining complete control over architecture and quality."
